Analyzing the incarceration data from 1970 to 2018 gives us some important insights. The average total jail population across all counties in the most recent year, 2018, is approximately 240 inmates per county. The county with the highest total jail population in 2018 recorded 24,000 inmates, while some counties had as few as 0 inmates. Over the last 50 years, the total jail population has increased significantly, growing from a few thousand to several hundred thousand. Specifically, in the year 2018, the Black jail population peaked at approximately 200,000, which highlights the significant racial disparities in incarceration rates. In comparison, the White jail population in the same year was around 300,000. Given the big difference between white and blakc population at that time, the ratio of population in jail to total population is much higher among black. From 1970 to 2018, the total jail population saw a dramatic increase, with the Black jail population increasing by about 180,000 and the White jail population by about 280,000. These findings underscore the need to address the underlying factors contributing to these disparities, such as socioeconomic conditions, law enforcement practices, and government policies.
### The Dataset
This dataset was collected by the Vera Institute of Justice, which is a nonprofit organization focused on criminal justice reform. They gathered the data from public records, including jail and prison reports from counties all over the United States, covering the years from 1970 to 2018. The main reason they collected this data was to understand incarceration trends and help create better public policies to reduce mass incarceration and address racial disparities.
There are over 3,000 rows in this dataset, with key columns like year, county name, total jail population, Black jail population, and White jail population. This data is really helpful for seeing how things have changed over time and comparing different racial groups and locations.
There are some important ethical issues and limitations to think about when using this data. One big concern is making sure the data is used to support fair policies and not to reinforce stereotypes or biases. Itâ€™s also important to consider who controls the data and how they might influence public opinion and decisions.
Another limitation is that some years or counties might have missing or incomplete data, which can make the analysis less accurate. Different counties might have reported their data in different ways, leading to inconsistencies. Even with these challenges, the dataset provides valuable insights into incarceration trends and shows the need for changes in the criminal justice system to address racial disparities.

I included this chart to show the trends in the total and Black jail populations over time. By displaying these trends, we can see how the overall jail population and the population of Black inmates have changed from 1970 to 2018. The chart reveals a significant increase in both populations over the years, with a particularly steep rise during the 1980s and 1990s. This period aligns with the implementation of stricter criminal justice policies and the War on Drugs. The chart highlights the disparities between the total and Black jail populations, emphasizing the need for policy interventions to address these issues.

I included this chart to compare the trends in the Black and White jail populations over time. This comparison helps us understand the racial disparities in incarceration rates. The chart shows that both Black and White jail populations have increased over the years, but the Black jail population has consistently been higher relative to the overall Black population in the U.S. This disparity indicates systemic issues within the criminal justice system that disproportionately affect Black individuals. The chart also highlights periods of sharp increases, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s, which correspond to changes in criminal justice policies.

I included the map to show the geographical distribution of the jail population across different counties in the United States. The map reveals interesting patterns, such as higher incarceration rates in some areas, which might be connected to local policies, economic conditions, or high population. By seeing these geographical differences, we can start to think about why certain areas have more people in jail and what can be done to address these issues. This information is crucial for developing targeted policies and interventions to reduce high incarceration rates in specific regions and address the underlying causes.

### Introduction
Incarceration is a big issue in the United States, especially when you look at how different racial groups are affected. This project focuses on understanding the trends and distribution of jail populations among different racial groups, particularly the total jail population, Black jail population, and White jail population over time and across various counties. By analyzing these variables, we hope to uncover patterns that show how different racial groups are impacted by incarceration. This analysis is important for informing policy decisions and addressing systemic problems within the criminal justice system.
### Summary Information
The "us-jail-pop.csv" dataset contains 153,811 entries with 28 columns. It provides detailed information on jail populations across various counties in the United States, spanning multiple years. Key columns include geographic identifiers like FIPS codes, state, and county names, demographic data such as total population and population aged 15-64, and specific jail population counts segmented by gender and race. The dataset includes information on total jail population, female and male jail populations, and further breakdowns into adult and juvenile populations. Additionally, racial categories such as AAPI, Black, Latinx, Native, White, and other races are detailed for jail populations. The urbanicity of counties is also recorded, providing a distinction between small/mid and large urban areas. While most columns have complete data, certain columns, especially those related to racial jail populations, have missing values. This dataset is valuable for analyzing trends and disparities in jail populations across different demographics and geographic locations over time. â€‹
### The Dataset
The Vera Institute of Justice is a nonprofit organization founded in 1961 to address injustices in the bail system in New York City. Its mission is to end the overcriminalization and mass incarceration of people of color, immigrants, and those experiencing poverty. Vera Institute focuses on creating evidence-based solutions to transform the criminal justice and immigration systems, ensuring they are fair and just for all.Vera's work includes initiatives to reduce incarceration rates, promote dignity for those in detention, and advance legal representation for immigrants. They collaborate with community members, government leaders, and other stakeholders to develop and test innovative programs aimed at disrupting the current systems of incarceration. Successful pilot programs are then scaled nationwide to maximize their impact. Some implications include systemic inequalities because they highlight racial adn ethnic disparities.Another implication is the mass incarceration as their data reveals the extent of mass incarceration in the United States.By being aware of these implications the community can work towards a more just and effective criminal justice system.

This chart compares the trends of the overall male jail population and to compare with the overall male juvenile population. I did this to see a glimpse of how much majority do male juventiles make upfor the male jail population. I realized that not many juveniles make up that population. It is just a very little percentage.

This map shows the jail population in each County's from the United States map. I did this because when we usually talk about jails or see cop cars they go by county or cities. Especially on the news they mention for example "King County Jails", so i found that The U.S. has a large and geographically dispersed population, making it impractical for a single, centralized system to manage all incarceration needs. County jails allow for more manageable and accessible detention facilities.

### Introduction
Incarceration is a big issue in the United States, especially when you look at how different racial groups are affected. This project focuses on understanding the trends and distribution of jail populations among different racial groups, particularly the total jail population, Black jail population, and White jail population over time and across various counties. By analyzing these variables, we hope to uncover patterns that show how different racial groups are impacted by incarceration. This analysis is important for informing policy decisions and addressing systemic problems within the criminal justice system.
### Summary Information
I used the "us-jail-pop.csv" dataset. It provides detailed information on jail populations across various counties in the United States, spanning multiple years. Key columns include geographic identifiers like FIPS codes, state, and county names, demographic data such as total population and population aged 15-64, and specific jail population counts segmented by gender and race. The dataset includes information on total jail population, female and male jail populations, and further breakdowns into adult and juvenile populations. Additionally, racial categories such as AAPI, Black, Latinx, Native, White, and other races are detailed for jail populations. The urbanicity of counties is also recorded, providing a distinction between small/mid and large urban areas. While most columns have complete data, certain columns, especially those related to racial jail populations, have missing values. This dataset is valuable for analyzing trends and disparities in jail populations across different demographics and geographic locations over time. â€‹
### The Dataset
The Vera Institute of Justice is a nonprofit organization founded in 1961 to address injustices in the bail system in New York City. Its mission is to end the overcriminalization and mass incarceration of people of color, immigrants, and those experiencing poverty. Vera Institute focuses on creating evidence-based solutions to transform the criminal justice and immigration systems, ensuring they are fair and just for all.Vera's work includes initiatives to reduce incarceration rates, promote dignity for those in detention, and advance legal representation for immigrants. They collaborate with community members, government leaders, and other stakeholders to develop and test innovative programs aimed at disrupting the current systems of incarceration. Successful pilot programs are then scaled nationwide to maximize their impact. Some implications include systemic inequalities because they highlight racial adn ethnic disparities.Another implication is the mass incarceration as their data reveals the extent of mass incarceration in the United States.By being aware of these implications the community can work towards a more just and effective criminal justice system.
### Trends Over Time Chart
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
# Load the datasets
data_path <- "us-jail-pop.csv"
us_jail_pop <- read.csv(data_path)
This chart shows the trends of the male jail population and female jail population. We can see that males are much more likey to be arrested than females over the years. This could be that women are generally arrested less frequently than men due to a combination of sociological, behavioral, and systemic factors.
### Variable Comparison Chart
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Aggregate data for comparison
juvenile_male_jail_pop_over_time <- us_jail_pop %>%
group_by(year) %>%
summarize(male_juvenile_jail_pop = sum(male_juvenile_jail_pop, na.rm = TRUE),
male_jail_pop = sum(male_jail_pop, na.rm = TRUE))
# Plot the comparison chart
ggplot(juvenile_male_jail_pop_over_time, aes(x = year)) +
geom_line(aes(y = male_juvenile_jail_pop, color = "male juvenile Jail Population")) +
geom_line(aes(y = male_jail_pop, color = "male Jail Population")) +
geom_point(aes(y = male_juvenile_jail_pop, color = "male juvenile Jail Population")) +
geom_point(aes(y = male_jail_pop, color = "male Jail Population")) +
ggtitle("Comparison of male juvenile and overall male jail population Over Time") +
xlab("Years overtime") +
ylab("Prison Population") +
scale_color_manual(values = c("male juvenile Jail Population" = "red", "male Jail Population" = "blue")) +
theme_minimal() +
labs(color = "comparison between male population and male juvenile")
This chart compares the trends of the overall male jail population and to compare with the overall male juvenile population. I did this to see a glimpse of how much majority do male juveniles make up for the male jail population. I realized that not many juveniles make up that population. It is just a very little percentage.

This map shows the jail population in each County's from the United States map. I did this because when we usually talk about jails or see cop cars they go by county or cities. Especially on the news they mention for example "King County Jails", so i found that The U.S. has a large and geographically dispersed population, making it impractical for a single, centralized system to manage all incarceration needs. County jails allow for more manageable and accessible detention facilities. Seeing the values with how many are incarcerated in each county are interesting to see the comparisions.
